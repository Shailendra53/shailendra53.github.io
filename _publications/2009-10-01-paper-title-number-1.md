excerpt: '<b>Abstract:</b> Much effort is being made to ensure the safety of people. One of the main requirements of
travellers and city administrators is to have knowledge of places that are more prone to criminal
activities. To rate a place as a potential crime location, it needs the past crime history at that
location. Such data is not easily available in the public domain, however, it floats around on the
Internet in the form of newspaper and social media posts, in an unstructured manner though.
Consequently, a large number of works are reported on extracting crime information from news
articles, providing piecemeal solutions to the problem. This chapter complements these works
by building an end-to-end framework for crime profiling of any given location/area. It customizes
individual components of the framework and provides a Spatio-temporal integration of crime
information. It develops an automated framework that crawls online news articles, analyzes
them, and extracts relevant information to create a crime knowledge base that gets dynamically
updated in real-time. The crime density can be easily visualized in the form of a heat map which
is generated by the knowledge base. As a case study, it investigates 345448 news articles
published by 6 daily English newspapers collected for approximately two years. Experimental
results show that the crime profiling matches with the ratings calculated manually by various
organizations.'
