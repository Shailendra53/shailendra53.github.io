======
Under the guidance of [Dr Shashi Shekhar Jha](https://sites.google.com/view/shashi-iitrpr/)
* Built a conversational chatbot using Sequence to Sequence model with Teacherforcing method
* Implemented bucketing method and Attention Mechanism to rightly weigh the important words in the userinput
* Used reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy of the model
